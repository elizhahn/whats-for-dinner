## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design Module 1 project. The project consists of building an application to match a provided comp. The MVP will allow the user to chose a meal type and a random recipe idea will be displayed. In addition to building the application MVP, three extra functionalities were built:

* Creating a login page that matches the comp. The user should be able to login and be taken to the main page
* User ability to add a recipe of their own that is displayed on the main page and will be stored with the other recipies according to meal type. 
* Ability to clear the recipe from the main page
* Error handling for login page and add a recipe bar


## Learning Goals

* Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
* Individualize your programming skill set


## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* GitHub

+ [Make Your Own Cover](#create-your-own-cover)
+ [Save Cover](#save-cover)

## Login Page

When user visits the page, they will be taken to a login page. Each input field has browser validation checks built in to ease user experience. The login page was designed to match the provided comp and create a feeling of unity.

## Main Page layout

The main page was built to match this [spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

## Make Your Own Cover
To create their own cover, the user can select the "Make Your Own Cover" button and enter values in each input field. To see their new cover, the user can then click "Make My Book". This button should take the user to the main view and display their new cover.

## Save Cover
To save their created cover, the user can select the "Save Cover" button. This button should save unique covers, no matter how many times this button is clicked. To view all saved covers, the user can select the "View Saved Covers" button.

## Delete Cover

To delete a cover, all a user needs to do is be in the saved covers section after clicking "View Saved Covers", and then double click on the cover they wish to delete. The cover should disappear from view.

## Challenges

* Figuring out how to manipulate CSS styling with JavaScript.
* Figuring out how to target a DOM event upon double-click, and manipulating associated data.
* GitHub.


---
## Wins

* Collaborating well on our first Paired Project, and helping each other understand new and complex concepts.
* Successfully applying correct CSS elements to create a beautiful display.
* Learning how to apply new concepts with every iteration.
* Practice debugging.

## Future Additions

* Implement data validation and error handling into form (disable the Make My Book button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is incorrect).
* When a user single-clicks a saved cover, create a Modal to view it larger
* Allow users to drag-and-drop saved covers into whatever order they want them to appear
